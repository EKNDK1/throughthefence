Dear mustapha 
You've been living in HELL for the past 365 days. It's indeed sad, the system you believe can protect you from the people is that make your life a living HELL has done more damage in your life than the "human trafickers". 
This is darkness moments of your life and how can you eat and feel the test of food or drinking or have enough sleep when you are constantly receiving negative information every day, week, and month for the past one year and at same time you are batling with a deathly disiase call "TB" which has been in your body for 3 years. 
I definely lost faith of DEMOCRATE because many thought that this is one of the best system in the world and this system fail to protect a basic human rights which the court refuse to follow there own constitution which said victims of human trafickings should'nt be in person but same system lock me up and refuse to set me free. 
What can you do
