from Elbæk prisonors. 

Complaining letter. 

We complain 3 security person in Elbæk, they treat us un respectfuly way. We canot aske them what we need. For example, the time we need to throw the wast[e] if you aske anything the[y] banish you and put isolation room. Sometimes the[y] beat the prisonors and use spray eyes.  

We hear some inmates crying loudly, and then they sent in Vestre (criminal prison). 

The[y] also bring sick people to our section, we eat every day plastic food which is not good for our healthe. 

No human basic rights such as telephon and freedom rights. 

We live here as animals, and even no one can not visit us from media.
