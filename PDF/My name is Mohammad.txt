My name is Mohammad. From Palestine. The West Bank.

While I was sitting in my room in Ellebæk prison, I began drawing a painting that includes a map of Palestine on a big piece of cardboard in the size of 70x100 cm. I wanted to draw on the cardboard and not directly on the walls of the room to make sure I did not break the rules.

I sketched out the map and in the middle of it, I drew the Palestinian flag in the colours of green, red and black. Under the painting I wrote "Free Palestine" with the same colours of the flag.

I stuck the painting to the wall next to the bed where I sleep, so that I wake up and go to sleep while Palestine is always free in my heart. My Algerian friend entered the room and said to me that he admired my patience in drawing this painting. He knew that it had taken me almost two hours. Afterwards there was a knock on the door of my room and the guards entered immediately. Two of them forced me out of the room because they wanted to ransack it. I left the room in confusion of what I did for them to search my room. Through the open door, I asked the guards if there was a reason behind the ransacking and he said to me "Stay out of here, and keep silent!". Then they left the room with the painting in their hands. As they left with it, they took a part of me with them. I asked him "why the painting?" and he replied that it is political and violates the rules.

I felt shocked and said "Does this human not watch the news, does he not know that there is a genocide against my people every day without the world doing anything about it". I knew now for certain that I am living in an unjust world. He asked about where I got the crayons from. I told them that the person I had shared the room with had passed them on to me.

One day Palestine will be victorious.

Note: They removed drawings from every room of the prison!!!
