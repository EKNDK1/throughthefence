A very well known Syrian poet, called Nizar Qabbani, was once asked: If you were not a poet, what would you like to be? 
He answered: I would love to be a bird in a Scandinavian country, because the, I will know for sure, that no one will interrupt my singing w/ a bullit in my throat.
- If this poet comes to live again today and find out about this prison he will be so disappointed. 
- From a former prisoner, I feel your pain my brothers, and I hope it will be healed soon.
