<h1>Voices Through The Fence</h1>
<p>
Voices Through the Fence is an ongoing publishing platform for drawings, notes, letters, and texts, written and produced by persons who are currently, or have been, detained in Ellebæk Deportation Prison, Allerød, Denmark.
<br>
Ellebæk is run by the Danish prison and probation service and is located in former military facilities. In their 2019 report, the European Committee against Torture (CPT) called Ellebæk “unacceptable” and criticized its poor material conditions, inadequate access to healthcare, arbitrary use of solitary confinement, and degrading treatment from staff.
<br>
The majority of those held in Ellebæk stay there for a few weeks, yet some remain up to 18 months awaiting possibly violent deportation. Many, however, cannot be forcefully deported due to their de facto statelessness or because the state Denmark wants to deport them to does not accept citizens forcefully returned. In these cases, months-long incarceration is used to pressure people into “collaborating” to return “freely”. Yet others do “collaborate” and express a wish to return, yet might still remain held for months.
<br>
Many of the persons detained in Ellebæk report experiencing chronic anxiety, fear, and anger. Many of them received medication against depression or sleep-deprivation, while access to healthcare is limited and communication to the outside world restricted.
<br>
The platform is edited and initiated by Ellebæk Contact Network, an activist collective visiting and systematically documenting conditions concerning Ellebæk.
