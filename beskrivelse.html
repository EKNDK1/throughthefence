<h1>Voices Through the Fence</h1>

<p>Voices Through the Fence is an ongoing publishing platform for drawings, notes, letters, and texts by persons who are currently, or have been, detained in Elleb&aelig;k deportation prison. Due to restrictions on basic means of communication, it is very difficult for people inside Elleb&aelig;k to get in touch with the outside world. Hoping to cut across Elleb&aelig;k&rsquo;s dividing borders, this website/blog will be continuously updated with contributions.</p>

<p>Elleb&aelig;k is run by the agency Denmark&rsquo;s Prisons (Danmarks F&aelig;ngsler) and is located next to a military base near Aller&oslash;d, Denmark.</p>

<p>Most detainees are held for a shorter period, while some are detained up to 18 months waiting for their deportation. Migration detention is a method used by the Danish state to pressure people to &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; by agreeing to return &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;, yet even those who do so may still be kept incarcerated, left in limbo with little prospect of being released or deported.</p>

<p>Many of the persons detained in Elleb&aelig;k report chronic anxiety, fear, and anger. Many receive medication for depression and sleep deprivation, while access to healthcare is limited and communication to the outside world restricted.</p>

<p>This platform is edited and initiated by Elleb&aelig;k Contact Network, an activist collective visiting and systematically documenting conditions concerning Elleb&aelig;k.</p>
